                  My journey started in high school when I faced stress that
                  hurt my health. I found meditation at age 15-16 years to help
                  me relieve stress. Then I graduated to face more than just
                  stressâ€”studying abroad, life-changing decision making,
                  channelings, pain, frustrations, loss, and disappointment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I decided to go deep within myself, to see the unseen and
                  hidden parts of self. I chose to take healing workshops and
                  classes to help myself first, so I can now share my years of
                  lessons and experiences with you with love.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground font-medium">
                  I found out that we all can heal ourselves if we find a
                  healthy, supportive community and individuals where we can be
                  ourselves without fear of shame or fear.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I host spaces online to connect and remind others they are not
                  alone, and there is always a place within us that is filled
                  with peace, bliss, and love.
